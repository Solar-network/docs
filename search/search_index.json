If the header is not present it will result in malformed responses or request rejections. Typically, this means that the node you are sending your requests to is out of sync and missing data that exists on other nodes that are in sync. To troubleshoot, ensure you're querying a node that is in sync, and third-party application restrictions are not blocking access. Querying the public Mainnet API is usually a good start. \"Why am I not seeing all my results?\" \u00b6 Most API calls accessing a list of resources (e.g., blocks and transactions) support pagination. If you're making requests and receiving an incomplete set of results, you're probably only seeing the first page. You'll need to request the remaining pages to get more results. It's important not to try to guess the format of the pagination URL. Not every API call uses the same structure. Instead, extract the pagination information from the meta field, which is sent with every request. \"My node is running, but API keeps returning CONNECTION REFUSED ?\" \u00b6 Note that the Public API is only available after a node has fully synced. This ensures your data on the blockchain is up to date. A full sync may take up to 15h, depending on your hardware configuration and network speed. If your node is synced and you still get CONNECTION_REFUSED error, please check your firewall configuration and if needed whitelist your client.","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"api/public-rest-api/troubleshooting/#troubleshooting","text":"If you're encountering some oddities in the API, here's a list of resolutions to some of the problems you may be experiencing.","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"api/public-rest-api/troubleshooting/#why-am-i-getting-a-404-error-on-a-resource-that-exists","text":"Tip All HTTP requests have to be sent with the Content-Type: application/json header.

Make sure to have this configuration listed after @solar-network/core-blockchain . { \"package\" : \"@solar-network/core-webhooks\" }, It is recommended to make configuration changes to these options by working with your .env file and the corresponding variables: Variable Description Type Default CORE_WEBHOOKS_ENABLED Enables or disabled the webhook API plugin boolean false CORE_WEBHOOKS_HOST The host to expose the API on string \"0.0.0.0\" CORE_WEBHOOKS_PORT The API port on which the plugin will listen integer 6004 The whitelist property can be changed directly in the app.json file and is an Array consisting of IP addresses that you allow to make connections to the webhook API. By default, only local access to the webhook API is allowed. This means that if you want to expose your webhook API to the outside, you'll need to explicitly add the IP addresses that you will use to this list (recommended approach). It is also possible to use wildcards to indicate a range of IPs (e.g. \"12.34.56.*\" ) or even to allow everyone (e.g. \"*\" ) (not recommended). { \"package\" : \"@solar-network/core-webhooks\" , \"options\" : { \"server\" : { \"whitelist\" : [ \"127.0.0.1\" , \"::ffff:127.0.0.1\" ] } } }, Remember that there is no further authentication on the webhooks API itself, meaning that everyone that can access it can add, edit and delete your webhooks.

Authorisation \u00b6 Before we start working on the implementation of a webhook handler, we will take a look at handling authorisation. To guarantee that only your server is allowed to send data to your webhook handler, an authorisation token is generated on creation of a webhook. The generated token will only be returned once and not be visible again. To generate an authorisation token, you need to create a webhook . Lets take the following token as an example fe944e318edb02b979d6bf0c87978b640c8e74e1cbfe36404386d33a5bbd8b66 which is 64 characters long and breaks down into 2 parts at 32 characters length each. The first 32 characters will be stored in the database and sent to you as a header Authorization: fe944e318edb02b979d6bf0c87978b64 via a POST request. The last 32 characters 0c8e74e1cbfe36404386d33a5bbd8b66 need to be stored by you and will serve as a way for you to verify that the request is authorised. Handling webhooks \u00b6 Now that we know how the token is structured and what it is used for we can continue with implementing a webhook handler. A webhook handler is just a simple POST endpoint that you need to implement at the URL you specified when creating a webhook. const webhookToken = \"fe944e318edb02b979d6bf0c87978b640c8e74e1cbfe36404386d33a5bbd8b66\" ; const verification = \"0c8e74e1cbfe36404386d33a5bbd8b66\" ; server . post ( \"/blocks\" , jsonParser , ( req , res ) => { // This will be fe944e318edb02b979d6bf0c87978b64 const authorisation = req . headers [ \"authorization\" ]; // This will be authorisation + verification const token = authorisation + verification ; // Make sure we block access if the token is invalid... if ( token !== webhookToken ) { return res . status ( 401 ). send ( \"Unauthorized!\" ); } // the datetime of when the webhook was sent console . log ( req . body . created ); // the data the webhook transferred, e.g. a block struct console . log ( req . body . data ); // the type of event that was sent, e.g. block.forged console . log ( req . body . type ); // do something with the above req.body data return res . status ( 200 ). send ( \"Hello Webhook!\" ); }); package main import ( \"fmt\" \"log\" \"net/http\" ) const ( webhookToken = \"fe944e318edb02b979d6bf0c87978b640c8e74e1cbfe36404386d33a5bbd8b66\" verification = \"0c8e74e1cbfe36404386d33a5bbd8b66\" ) func validateOrigin ( next http .

A transaction is an atomic change in the state of the blockchain. The simplest form transfers value from address A to B, incorporating a fee for the processing. Transactions are bundled into a block. At that moment they are committed to the blockchain and become irreversible. All valid transactions are submitted as payload data via the Public REST API and are immutable once added to the blockchain (i.e., included in blocks). While the implementation specifics will depend on the platform used to submit the transaction, SXP's extensive SDK coverage ensures that developers experience a unified workflow across languages and platforms. In the next sections we will look into the transaction lifecycle from creation to final inclusion in the blocks. Transaction journey from client To blockchain \u00b6 1. Create and sign transaction locally \u00b6 Transactions are generated and signed locally with one of many available SDK libraries . Locally generated and signed transactions are sent as a POST request with transaction data to a server running Core. Danger Core will accept a valid transaction, signed with a valid signature from a private key. Make sure you invoke the SDK builder's sign method on your transaction object using the sender's private key. 2. Receive and validate transaction on a server running Core \u00b6 Transactions are sent to the POST /api/transactions endpoint of the Public API. From there all requests are first validated by the API endpoint schema. Each endpoint schema defines the structure that requests should conform to. Transaction flow in short: Transaction Payload is received by Core ( Public API Endpoint ) API Handler validates schema and sends transaction to the TransactionProcessor TransactionProcessor performs additional transaction payload checks in relation to the blockchain protocol. If all checks are valid, the transaction is added to the pool Note All Client SDKs already create API requests to conform to this standard so will typically result in your transaction passing validation. Notably, no blockchain-level validation occurs at this earliest stage in the transaction lifecycle. Request validation ensures that your POST request can be understood by the network, not that the data it contains represents a valid transaction. This task falls to the next class to handle transaction requests: the TransactionProcessor from Core's pool package. Assuming validation is successful, the posted transactions are processed by the request handler, which passes the data to the TransactionProcessor for validation. All transactions submitted to the TransactionProcessor are returned in one of four arrays : accept broadcast excess invalid Internally, the TransactionProcessor processes transactions in its validate method by separating: transactions already in the pool transactions from blocked senders transactions from the future transactions with low fees for broadcast/pool inclusion transactions that fail to conform to their transaction type Info At this point, Core has a list of incoming transactions to add to the pool. TransactionProcessor now checks the pool to see whether it is at capacity. If so, it compares the incoming transactions against the pooled transactions and removes the transactions with the lowest fees. 3. From transaction pool to transaction inclusion within blocks \u00b6 Transactions move out of the pool once a forging delegate (block producer) is ready and eligible to forge it. At the moment of forging, transactions in the forger's pool are grouped into a potential block and passed to the delegate's forge method for inclusion in a block. Inside the forge method, all transaction values, fees, and IDs within the block are added together. The values and fees are used to calculate block metadata, while the hashed IDs are concatenated and used as the block's payloadHash property. With this information in hand, the block data and sorted transactions are passed to the crypto library's Block.create method alongside the forging delegate's keys. 4. Block creation \u00b6 A block is a collection of transactions, but also it is the incremental unit of the blockchain. Every eight seconds, an active delegate produces a new block by bundling a bunch of transactions, verifying each transaction, and signing the block. Blocks hold quite a lot of metadata on the SXP blockchain, like: Height, an incremental ID. Timestamp. Transactions. Creator's signature. Total transfer amount. Total fee amount. The Block.create method uses the following algorithm to create a new block: Derive the delegate's public key from the function's keys parameter. Create a payload hash by serialising the block data into a binary-encoded format. Create a SHA256 hash by using the payload hash as input. Sign the SHA256 hash with the delegate's private key. Create a block ID using the hashed block data. Cast the data into a Block model using the new transaction and block ID. Return the cast Block object. 5. Block propagation \u00b6 With the forged block successfully returned to the forger library, the only remaining responsibility is to let the network know about the new block - block propagation. The forged block is relayed to peers via the peer-to-peer protocol.","title":"Understanding the Lifecycle"},{"location":"core/transactions/lifecycle/#understanding-the-transaction-lifecycle","text":"Describing the journey of a transaction from client to Core.

This benefits the end user and delegates by lowering transaction fees per payment and reducing congestion. Solar Core allows up to 256 payments to be combined within a single transaction. All Solar transactions contain a special data field of 255 bytes known as the 'Memo'. This data field allows raw data, code, or plain text to be stored on the blockchain. The Memo is optional, public, and immutable.

Anywhere from 1 to 53 delegates in total may be voted for. The wallet's vote weight can be distributed evenly across their chosen delegates or customised by setting the distribution percentage as desired. Once a wallet is actively voting, funds can be sent and received freely and its vote weight adjusts accordingly. To vote for a new delegate or set of delegates, create a new vote transaction containing the list of delegates for which you'd like to vote.

Anywhere from 1 to 53 delegates in total may be voted for. The wallet's vote weight can be distributed evenly across their chosen delegates or customised by setting the distribution percentage as desired. Once a wallet is actively voting, funds can be sent and received freely and its vote weight adjusts accordingly.

The 'memo' \u00b6 All Solar transactions now contain a special 255-byte data field known as a 'Memo' and allows raw data, code, or plain text to be stored on the blockchain. The Memo is optional, public, and immutable. This was previously known as the vendorField and was only available on certain transaction types. v3 transfer \u00b6 TypeGroup Type 1 6 One of the most important changes is the introduction of the new Transfer transaction type. Formerly, a single send transaction made use of v2-style Transfers (Type 0) whereas two or more sends required using a v2 MultiPayment transaction (Type 6). Under Solar Core 4.x , these have been combined under the MultiPayment pattern and are now known simply as 'Transfer' (Type 6), removing the unnecessary requirement of two separate transaction types. See the v3 Transfer structure here . TypeScript Code Example: const { Transactions , Managers , Utils } = require ( \"@solar-network/crypto\" ); const { Connection } = require ( \"@solar-network/client\" ); // Configure our API client const client = new Connection ( \"https://tapi.solar.org/api\" ); // Set the network configuration Managers . configManager . setFromPreset ( \"testnet\" ); Managers . configManager . setHeight ( 972604 ); ( async () => { // Step 1: Retrieve the incremental nonce of the sender wallet const senderWallet = await client . api ( \"wallets\" ). get ( \"YOUR_SENDER_WALLET_ADDRESS\" ); const senderNonce = Utils .

Previously, a wallet could vote for only one delegate at a time. Under the new scheme, a wallet can vote for up to 53 delegates in total as well as optionally customise the distribution of their vote weight. For instance, the default behaviour of voting for three delegates where no custom distribution is specified would look as follows: { ... \"votes\" : { \"cactus1549\" : 33.34 , \"gym\" : 33.33 , \"sl33p\" : 33.33 } ... } Note Note that the vote weight is distributed evenly and uses a natural sorting order. Because the vote weight must total 100%, the remaining 0.01% is subsequently distributed in ascending order. When manually specifying vote weight distribution, natural sorting is still used; however, vote weight is prioritised while determining the list's order. For example: { ... \"votes\" : { \"sl33p\" : 40.50 , \"cactus1549\" : 29.75 , \"gym\" : 29.75 } ... } See the v3 Vote structure here . v3 Delegate Resignation types \u00b6 TypeGroup Type 1 7 Previously, v2-style Delegate Resignation was a permanent action. There was no way for a resigned delegate to reinstate their eligibility to receive votes and produce blocks. This was only useful in cases where a delegate no longer wanted to participate in network consensus. Solar Core 4.x adds a new 'Temporary' resignation option where their resigned status may be 'Revoked' after at least two rounds (~106 blocks). This is useful when a delegate may only wish to resign for a short time without negatively impacting the network (e.g., missing blocks) and can be for a variety of reasons, from temporary node maintenance to personal/private matters. Resignation Type Value Description Temporary 0 Resign only for a short time. Delegate will be temporarily blocked from receiving votes or forging. (the default when no resign type is declared) Permanent 1 Irreversible. Delegate will no longer be allowed to receive votes or forge. Revoke 2 Reverses a temporary resignation.

It is based on the Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism and has 53 active Delegates (Validators) who secure the network. In this article, we will discuss how block rewards work within the Solar blockchain and how you can earn a portion of the rewards by becoming an active delegate or voting with your SXP coins. Staking considerations \u00b6 SXP Staking is unique in that user funds are not required to be sent or locked. When a user casts a vote, their vote-weight is assigned to the network Validator (Delegate) of their choice. A user\u2019s vote-weight adjusts automatically as funds are sent and received, and there is no need to re-vote or un-stake. To change a vote, a user simply un-votes their current Validator and elects another by casting a new vote transaction. Info For more information about voting and unvoting, please visit: How to Vote or Unvote a Delegate Staking fees \u00b6 The cost of a vote covers the transaction itself. There is no requirement to send or lock additional funds in order to participate in consensus. This transaction fee is awarded to the Validator who forges the transaction in a given block. Info For more information about fees, please visit: Transaction Fees Block rewards \u00b6 Solar is a sovereign blockchain that is validated by 53 active Delegates. Each Delegate will submit (1) block per round. A round consists of 53 blocks. Each block on Solar has a block time of 8 seconds. Each block awards the active delegate who submits the block a dynamic and rank-based block reward with the 10% any transaction fees from that block. Block Rewards are inflationary coins, meaning the total SXP supply is increased by between x and x SXP every block. This serves as a form of consistent inflation that reduces over time due to the non-fluctuating rate of rewards. On Solar, 100% of the block reward goes to the Validator. Note: There are no \"halvenings\" of block rewards on Solar . Reward sharing on Solar \u00b6 As previously stated, block rewards and transaction fees are awarded to the active delegate responsible for reporting a given block. We call this combination of the block reward and 10% of any fees the total reward. On Solar, many of these delegates choose to take a small commission from the total reward and share the remaining after commission reward (ACR) with their voters. This form of reward sharing is completely optional and not all delegates will share their rewards Reward sharing can vary wildly with delegates taking commissions of anywhere from 0-100% of the total rewards.

Many queries can be performed using the Client SDK alone, while the Crypto SDK performs any actions requiring cryptographic functionality (i.e., signing transactions). At a surface level, the two SDKs are separated by their functions and intended use cases: The Crypto SDK provides the cryptographic functions necessary to verify and validate Solar transactions. The Client SDK provides wrapper functions to unify and streamline API calls between your application and the Solar blockchain. Put another way, the Crypto SDK structures your data in a format that all Solar nodes can understand, while the Client SDK handles the actual communication between your application and a Solar node. Where the Crypto SDK is internal, the Client SDK is external, as the below diagram illustrates: Note The Public API is only available after a node has fully synced. This ensures your data on the blockchain is up to date. Setup \u00b6 These quick actions will all assume you've loaded a Client instance with the IP address of your node and the API version you're requesting. import { Connection } from \"@solar-network/client\" ; const client = new Connection ( \"https://tapi.solar.org/api\" ); Tip Use https://api.solar.org/api for the Solar Network mainnet. You can also use the IP address and port of any Core node that has the Public API enabled (e.g., http://65.108.90.71:6003 ) . Check wallet balance \u00b6 Checking a wallet balance involves using the wallets resource to GET the wallet corresponding to a given Solar address. const wallet = await client . api ( \"wallets\" ). get ( \"D61mfSggzbvQgTUe6JhYKH2doHaqJ3Dyib\" ); console . log ( wallet . body . data . balance ); Find block information \u00b6 If you know the ID of the block you are looking for, you can use the GET method on the blocks resource to return information on that block. const block = await client . api ( \"blocks\" ). get ( \"405899a308c07aee8a7b4fb807d03ca4454ee5ba295365b302e30683c5c01be5\" ); console . log ( block ); Alternatively, if you are not sure of the block ID, or if you want to find all blocks in a range, you can make use of the blocks all method. This endpoint accepts a JSON object representing the search parameters to use when narrowing down a list of blocks. The following block properties can be used to create your range: timestamp height numberOfTransactions totalAmount totalFee reward payloadLength To use any of these properties as a range, include the relevant key in your request as an object containing from and to specifiers. For example, this code can be used to search all blocks between blockchain heights 720 and 735 with total fees between 0 and 2000 satoshi: const blocks = await client . api ( \"blocks\" ). all ({ height : { from : 500000 , to : 800000 }, totalFee : { from : 0 , to : 2000 } }); console . log ( blocks ); // all blocks matching the search criteria Create and broadcast transactions \u00b6 To create transactions, make use of the transactionBuilder module of @solar-network/crypto . First, install the package from pnpm or equivalent: pnpm install @solar-network/crypto The crypto package functionality we'll use here is the transactionBuilder, which provides a series of \"chainable\" methods that can be called, one after another, to produce a transaction object. These methods create and define your transaction: its type, its amount in satoshi, its signature, and more. Regardless of which SDK you use, every transactionBuilder contains a similar function to getStruct , which will return a completed transaction object. After making one or more of these transaction objects, you can combine them into an array to use as the transactions key in your request. With all the steps together, here is an example of how to send a transaction for approval: import { Transactions , Managers , Utils } from \"@solar-network/crypto\" ; import { Connection } from \"@solar-network/client\" ; // Configure our API client const client = new Connection ( \"https://tapi.solar.org/api\" ); // Set the network configuration Managers . configManager . setFromPreset ( \"testnet\" ); Managers . configManager . setHeight ( 1000000 ); ( async () => { // Step 1: Retrieve the incremental nonce of the sender wallet const senderWallet = await client . api ( \"wallets\" ). get ( \"YOUR_SENDER_WALLET_ADDRESS\" ); const senderNonce = Utils . BigNumber . make ( senderWallet . body . data . nonce ). plus ( 1 ); // Step 2: Create the transaction const transaction = Transactions . BuilderFactory . transfer () . nonce ( senderNonce . toFixed ()) . fee ( \"30000000\" ) . memo ( \"This is an example memo\" ) // memo is optional . addTransfer ( \"Address of Recipient Wallet 1\" , \"100000000\" ) // 1 tSXP . addTransfer ( \"Address of Recipient Wallet 2\" , \"200000000\" ) // 2 tSXP . addTransfer ( \"Address of Recipient Wallet 3\" , \"300000000\" ) // 3 tSXP . sign ( \"this is a top secret passphrase\" ); // Step 4: Broadcast the transaction const broadcastResponse = await client . api ( \"transactions\" ). create ({ transactions : [ transaction . build (). toJson ()] }); // Step 5: Log the response console . log ( JSON . stringify ( broadcastResponse . body . data , null , 4 )) })(); When sending your request using the client , ensure that the value of transactions is an array, even if you have only one transaction object. If your request is successful, you will receive a response with the following data key: { data : { accept : [ '96e3952b66a370d8145055b55cedc6f1435b3a71cb17334aa954f8844ad1202f' ], broadcast : [ '96e3952b66a370d8145055b55cedc6f1435b3a71cb17334aa954f8844ad1202f' ], excess : [], invalid : [] }, errors : null } Let us look at the returned data object in more depth. It is composed of four arrays, each holding zero or more transaction IDs: accept - a list of all accepted transactions broadcast - a list of all transactions broadcast to the network excess - if the node's pool is full, this lists all excess transactions invalid - a list of all transactions deemed invalid by the node Our sample code above submitted one transaction, which the node accepted and broadcast and thus the accept and broadcast arrays contain precisely one item each: the ID of the transaction we submitted. If we had submitted any invalid transactions, the invalid list would have contained their IDs, and the errors key would have been populated with one error per invalid transaction. The diagram below offers a top-level overview of the transaction submission process: Check transaction confirmations \u00b6 Once a transaction has been created and added to the blockchain, you can access the number of confirmations it has by using the transactions resource to get the value matching the transaction ID. const transaction = await client . api ( \"transactions\" ). get ( \"5ad7a65e68ac24821f90504202cb464fb845faa53736f16b94f6756a2dc2bea3\" ); console . log ( transaction ); If the transaction has been added to the blockchain, you'll receive the following data structure in your console: { \"data\" : { \"id\" : \"5ad7a65e68ac24821f90504202cb464fb845faa53736f16b94f6756a2dc2bea3\" , \"blockHeight\" : 1509707 , \"blockId\" : \"2d17c1ee22b01534de020d6e882ec23d8a66142619b35e447c69696a1191fe27\" , \"version\" : 3 , \"type\" : 6 , \"typeGroup\" : 1 , \"amount\" : \"1918575037\" , \"fee\" : \"5174942\" , \"burnedFee\" : \"4657447\" , \"sender\" : \"D6nqkGkzyxWhqTvA1txgABHWexh4UMr8ff\" , \"senderPublicKey\" : \"03aebd4e0ea4b0eb3ad5ce7870af32e709fcf4d65ed9c9cb383aea83c687e1e1fb\" , \"signature\" : \"05b3652cf407261636a74e71c3d01c4e3bd09e5ec13fd54ff598319ae70d2fa0a915c5a318d6439c90df27aa18b6d844e9bc906636fb2b4da17f959469cf5aa7\" , \"memo\" : \"friendsoflittleyus - Daily payout - thank you for your support\" , \"asset\" : { \"transfers\" : [ { \"amount\" : \"264150058\" , \"recipientId\" : \"DM5jxyfM2kj5LGT3sXaD5P2bpQJW56XnBq\" }, { \"amount\" : \"269325000\" , \"recipientId\" : \"DJ5JdUocNY6MxfcPBzKAoUo2k4JUACFrQA\" }, { \"amount\" : \"38475000\" , \"recipientId\" : \"DGymbo8YN2RJoa72ZJTkLfZTrh7LCTwFnx\" }, { \"amount\" : \"1097266704\" , \"recipientId\" : \"D646b6dx3sW5NAgMDTKAZ2hdC57K1BeRaK\" }, { \"amount\" : \"124825386\" , \"recipientId\" : \"DAWwtPkrCZ6kPKfuBfNMkXVZFcTu72QmNU\" }, { \"amount\" : \"89640155\" , \"recipientId\" : \"DM5jxyfM2kj5LGT3sXaD5P2bpQJW56XnBq\" }, { \"amount\" : \"24416295\" , \"recipientId\" : \"DJ5JdUocNY6MxfcPBzKAoUo2k4JUACFrQA\" }, { \"amount\" : \"10016614\" , \"recipientId\" : \"DEz9aPVTXCYPManZHSKL7zqkMn7hUVusGe\" }, { \"amount\" : \"350460\" , \"recipientId\" : \"DNd2nfU6FWs1CJdbDyWbm6nPAXZcSexGKL\" }, { \"amount\" : \"39498\" , \"recipientId\" : \"DEnWWJsWCvqfoTghim9PZgUMJZ2CaPEe7M\" }, { \"amount\" : \"26664\" , \"recipientId\" : \"DGpcLotbiUsQpXoD5m7MbhjVdspRgd6nuX\" }, { \"amount\" : \"26646\" , \"recipientId\" : \"DUALogApuf5Md38x5yv2uqVe4HoWzy2U1p\" }, { \"amount\" : \"5334\" , \"recipientId\" : \"DHm3eCeBWKdPwAc6JFUZoArLkrnTd1pnQz\" }, { \"amount\" : \"5325\" , \"recipientId\" : \"DL15Z3K8k2TCoqKPB8TZjTv89ApvDPoUZd\" }, { \"amount\" : \"2697\" , \"recipientId\" : \"DGSzda5FfkQDPUmFrM4Xodty2LWnamTpCk\" }, { \"amount\" : \"2670\" , \"recipientId\" : \"DEAH8FiXrxfGaoHE7PEHtgz8rxzpqRQMGT\" }, { \"amount\" : \"531\" , \"recipientId\" : \"DQYiSMyoftk7KibjtaD2ppUe1KnxF4MvCT\" } ] }, \"confirmations\" : 189 , \"timestamp\" : { \"epoch\" : 12258008 , \"unix\" : 1670598008 , \"human\" : \"2022-12-09T15:00:08.000Z\" }, \"nonce\" : \"6168\" } } You can see that the confirmations key holds the number of confirmations this transaction has received from the network, in the above case 0. As the average block takes 8 seconds to forge, finality is typically established within a minute following a transaction's addition to the blockchain. Listening for transactions \u00b6 it is possible to retrieve all transactions of a wallet given its address and, optionally, add filters. // Getting all transaction of a wallet sent after height 1000000 const transactions = await client . api ( \"wallets\" ). transactions ( \"D61mfSggzbvQgTUe6JhYKH2doHaqJ3Dyib\" , { blockHeight : { from : 1000000 }}); console . log ( transactions . body . data ); Info Transfer transactions can be either LegacyTransfer (typegroup 1, type 0) or Transfer (typegroup 1, type 6). When listening for incoming transactions, it is essential to monitor for both of these types of transfer. Check node status \u00b6 Checking node status can be done by using the node resource's status method: const status = await client . api ( \"node\" ). status (); console . log ( status ); By running this code, you'd see the output in your console resembling the following object: { \"data\" : { \"synced\" : true , // whether this node is fully synchronised with the network \"now\" : 1509905 , // the current network height of this node's blockchain \"blocksCount\" : 0 , // if not synced, the number of blocks yet to be synced \"timestamp\" : 12259598 // the node's current network (epoch) time } } If synced is true, your node is operating as expected and fully synced with the Solar network.

Since they serve anonymous users and to protect against DDoS attacks, Solar Core nodes have strict rate limits. Enterprise users (such as exchanges) might encounter a problem creating large batches of transactions and broadcasting them. The rate limit can be configured in multiple ways to solve these problems. Exceeding the rate limit \u00b6 By default, rate limits are enabled on Solar Core nodes. When the rate limit is exceeded; a 429 HTTP status is returned. Configuring the rate limit \u00b6 You can fine tune or completely disable the node's rate limit by editing the .env file found at ~/.config/solar-core/{network}/.env . Find most important parameters below: CORE_API_RATE_LIMIT_DISABLED = true CORE_API_RATE_LIMIT_USER_LIMIT = 300 CORE_API_RATE_LIMIT_WHITELIST = 127.0.0.1 , 192.168.1.1 , 172.31.255.1 Setting CORE_API_RATE_LIMIT_DISABLED=true will globally disable all rate limits. For internal use this is safe. More fine-grained control may be exerted by using CORE_API_RATE_LIMIT_USER_LIMIT , which uses IP addresses to assign rate limits. The unit is requests/minute (default: 100 requests/per minute/per IP). Excluding certain IP addresses from rate limiting can be achieved by setting CORE_API_RATE_LIMIT_WHITELIST= followed by comma separated list of IP addresses (default: 172.0.0.1).

Getting started \u00b6 The instructions on this page will guide you through creating a new user account with the correct privileges, installing and configuring Solar Core, then starting a relay instance and logging the output using the installation script. Directly below is a quick summary of these install commands: adduser solar su -l solar wget -O install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solar-network/core/main/install.sh bash install.sh solar relay:start pm2 logs Step-by-step installation via the install script \u00b6 If you are planning to setup a new server you can execute the following steps. Step 1: Create a new account \u00b6 Create a new dedicated user account to manage SXP-related software. We\u2019ll illustrate this command as adduser solar to create a user by the name of \u2018solar\u2019 , but you can chose something else, if preferred. On your server, type the following into the command line: adduser solar You'll be asked to create and confirm a new user password, and be prompted to enter the user\u2019s full name and some other information. ( Feel free to leave them blank by pressing \u2018enter\u2019, they are all optional fields. ) When prompted to confirm, type \u2018Y\u2019 and press \u2018enter\u2019 to finish. Adding user 'solar' ... Adding new group 'solar' ( 1000 ) ... Adding new user 'solar' ( 1000 ) with group 'solar' ... Creating home directory '/home/solar' ... Copying files from '/etc/skel' ... Enter new UNIX password: Retype new UNIX password: passwd: password updated successfully Changing the user information for solar Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default Full Name [] : Room Number [] : Work Phone [] : Home Phone [] : Other [] : Is the information correct? [ Y/n ] Y Step 2: Login as the new user \u00b6 We now should switch to the user account created above, this will also land us in the user's base directory ( ~/ ). Info In this example we use 'solar' for the name of the new user account, but you should use whatever username was set in the previous steps above. Enter the following command into your terminal: su -l solar Step 3: Run the installation script \u00b6 Here, we will use the install.sh script. This installs Solar Core and all of its dependencies onto your server, then publishes the configuration files for it. Run the install script by copying and pasting this one line command into your terminal: wget -O install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solar-network/core/main/install.sh bash install.sh \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2557 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2557 \u2588\u2588\u2557 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2557 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2557 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2557 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2557 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2557 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2557 \u2588\u2588\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\u2588\u2588\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2588\u2588\u2557\u2588\u2588\u2551 \u2588\u2588\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2588\u2588\u2557\u2588\u2588\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2588\u2588\u2557 \u2588\u2588\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\u2588\u2588\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2588\u2588\u2557\u2588\u2588\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2588\u2588\u2557\u2588\u2588\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2557\u2588\u2588\u2551 \u2588\u2588\u2551\u2588\u2588\u2551 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2551\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2554\u255d \u2588\u2588\u2551 \u2588\u2588\u2551 \u2588\u2588\u2551\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2554\u255d\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2557 \u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2588\u2588\u2551\u2588\u2588\u2551 \u2588\u2588\u2551\u2588\u2588\u2551 \u2588\u2588\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2588\u2588\u2551\u2588\u2588\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2588\u2588\u2557 \u2588\u2588\u2551 \u2588\u2588\u2551 \u2588\u2588\u2551\u2588\u2588\u2554\u2550\u2550\u2588\u2588\u2557\u2588\u2588\u2554\u2550\u2550\u255d \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2551\u255a\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2554\u255d\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2557\u2588\u2588\u2551 \u2588\u2588\u2551\u2588\u2588\u2551 \u2588\u2588\u2551 \u255a\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2557\u255a\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2554\u255d\u2588\u2588\u2551 \u2588\u2588\u2551\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2557 \u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d \u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d \u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d\u255a\u2550\u255d \u255a\u2550\u255d\u255a\u2550\u255d \u255a\u2550\u255d \u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d \u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d \u255a\u2550\u255d \u255a\u2550\u255d\u255a\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u255d Thanks for choosing to install Solar Core!

What is Solar? \u00b6 A decentralised community-driven blockchain project. Solar is focused on creating an ecosystem with true governance. An ecosystem with open-source developers and community involvement. 1.2 Project mission \u00b6 Solar is a blockchain with its own native SXP coin. The SXP blockchain offers a wide variety of features and tools that allows us to level with enterprise-grade applications. 1.3 Project key highlights \u00b6 Community-focused Competing with top tier crypto projects Open-source tools with many use-cases Scalable and secure using the latest blockchain technology Deflationary and inflationary at the same time 2. Solar products and technical infrastructure \u00b6 2.1 Existing products \u00b6 Solar Wallet The main software to interact directly with the SXP blockchain is by using the so-called Solar wallets. The initial Solar wallets are forked from the ARK repositories and it offers basic functions to send and receive SXP coins and to vote for delegates on the SXP blockchain. New desktop, mobile, and browser wallets are currently being developed to interact with all the features that the SXP blockchain has to offer, such as creating tokens, interacting with the metaverse, tools to monitor the blockchain and a lot more. 2.2 Technical infrastructure \u00b6 Solar is powered by Solar Core. A safe and secure Layer-1 Blockchain Framework. Solar utilises the Delegated Proof of Stake Consensus, also known as DPoS. The Blockchain with its own native coin named SXP is fast, modular, sustainable, efficient and fully decentralised without the known issues and vulnerabilities from traditional Proof of Work (PoW) blockchains. Issues and vulnerabilities such as being energy intensive or the risk of taking part in 51% attack vectors. The Blockchain Framework has been forked from ARK Core. Solar Core improved on the security of the Blockchain Framework by fully utilising Schnorr for signatures. Solar Core entirely drops all support for ECDSA due to persistent signature malleability vectors. Solar Core also provides a more robust block production routine to minimise the likelihood of nodes missing blocks and therefore creating a more stable and operational blockchain. Security first. The blockchain framework is open-source and actively maintained on Github by dedicated Core developers. Anyone is able to create a PR or open an issue on our Github repositories to discuss or point at a potential vulnerability in our code. These issues will always have the highest priority and will be taken seriously to ensure that the framework will always be safe to use for our users and for anyone participating in the Solar DAO. The Solar Core has several enhancements such as the Side Ledger Protocol for token issuing with and without metadata and custom transaction types to allow \u201cburning\u201d and \u201cSolContract\u201d which allows the creation of Solidity Smart Contracts on the SXP Blockchain. The Solar Core also enables dynamic forging rewards based on the position of a delegate. 3. SXP coin overview & use cases \u00b6 SXP utilises a Delegated Proof of Stake concensus, from which the forging rewards are distributed to delegates. The delegates are able to further distribute these rewards to their voters and keep a percentage as reward for the contribution to the network. 90% of the transaction fees are automatically burned on the network and 10% are rewarded to delegates that forge the block with the fees. Users may use the SXP coin in the following ways: Payments Create fungible and non-fungible tokens Use SXP in the Metaverse Staking Funding projects on the launchpad Voting in Governance Proposals 4. Team \u00b6 The Solar Project mainly consists of open-source developers from several top tier projects with Nayiem Willems as the project leader for 2022. At time of writing, the Solar team has 25 developers working on the initial start of the project. With the delegating consensus, Solar aims to bring more developers or contributors to the project and reward them with the forging rewards generated by the delegates. Solar will also additionally have a Community Fund to fund individual projects that are using the SXP blockchain.

These dependencies are the Crypto SDK and Client SDK . You can head on over to their documentations to read more about them but for now we are only concerned with installing them to get up and running. Open your project and execute the following commands to install both SDKs. Make sure that those complete without any errors. If you encounter any errors, please open an issue with as much information as you can provide so that our developers can have a look and get to the bottom of the issue. pnpm \u00b6 pnpm add @solar-network/crypto pnpm add @solar-network/client npm \u00b6 npm install @solar-network/crypto npm install @solar-network/client yarn \u00b6 yarn add @solar-network/crypto yarn add @solar-network/client Now that we're setup and ready to go we'll look into some examples for the most common tasks you'll encounter when wanting to interact with the SXP Blockchain. Persisting your transaction on the blockchain \u00b6 The process of getting your transaction verified and persisted on the SXP Blockchain involves a few steps with which our SDKs will help you but lets break them down to get a better idea of what is happening. Install the Client SDK and configure it to use a node of your choosing to broadcast your transactions to. Always make sure that you have a fallback node that you can use for broadcasting in case your primary node goes offline or acts strange otherwise. Install the Crypto SDK and configure it to match the configuration of the network. This is the most important part as misconfiguration can lead to a myriad of issues as Core will reject your transactions. Retrieve the nonce of the sender wallet and increase it by 1. You can read about what a sequential nonce is and why it is important here . Create an instance of the builder for the type of transaction you want to create. This is the step where we actually create a transaction and sign it so that the SXP Blockchain can later on verify it and decide if it will be accepted and finally forged. Turn the newly created transaction into JSON and broadcast it to the network through the Client SDK. Process the API response and verify that your transaction was accepted. If the network rejects your transaction you'll receive the reason as to why that is the case in the response which might mean that you need to create a new transaction and broadcast it. Troubleshooting \u00b6 A common issue when trying to get your transaction onto the blockchain is that you'll receive an error to the effect of Transaction Version 2 is not supported which indicates that your Crypto SDK configuration might be wrong. The solution to this is to make sure that your Crypto SDK instance is properly configured. This includes both the network preset and the height it's configured to assume the network has passed, if any of those don't match up you'll encounter the aforementioned issue with the version of your transactions.

Install the Client SDK and configure it to use a node of your choosing to broadcast your transactions to. Always make sure that you have a fallback node that you can use for broadcasting in case your primary node goes offline or acts strange otherwise. Install the Crypto SDK and configure it to match the configuration of the network. This is the most important part as misconfiguration can lead to a myriad of issues as Core will reject your transactions. Retrieve the nonce of the sender wallet and increase it by 1. You can read about what a sequential nonce is and why it is important here . Create an instance of the builder for the type of transaction you want to create. This is the step where we actually create a transaction and sign it so that the SXP Blockchain can later on verify it and decide if it will be accepted and finally forged. Turn the newly created transaction into JSON and broadcast it to the network through the Client SDK. Process the API response and verify that your transaction was accepted. If the network rejects your transaction you'll receive the reason as to why that is the case in the response which might mean that you need to create a new transaction and broadcast it.","title":"Persisting your transaction on the blockchain"},{"location":"sdk/typescript/complementary-examples/#troubleshooting","text":"A common issue when trying to get your transaction onto the blockchain is that you'll receive an error to the effect of Transaction Version 2 is not supported which indicates that your Crypto SDK configuration might be wrong.

A delegate is a regular wallet that has broadcast a registration transaction, acquired a sufficient number of votes, and has a Relay Node configured to forge new blocks through a forger module. At any time only 53 delegates are active. They are cost-efficient miners running the SXP network. Info Voters are wallets which have broadcast a vote transaction on a delegate. A vote remains active until an un-vote transaction is sent (it does not have to be recast unless a wallet wishes to change from delegate). Voting for a delegate does not give the delegate access to the wallet nor does it lock the coins in it.

This is facilitated by a contract on BEP20 and ERC20. The process consists on 2 main functions. 1. The first function \"approve\", which exists on the Swipe (SXP) token contract, this serves for the purpose of approving the SXPSwap contract to move the Swipe tokens over the new SXPSwap Contract. 2. The second function \"transferTokenToContract\", this serves for the purpose of sending the tokens that were previously approved to SXPSwap. Functions on the new contract. The function \"transferTokenToContract\" is only accepted if the following parameters are included. These parameters are: Address of Swipe token. Amount of tokens to be transferred. A valid SXP mainnet address to be entered in string format. If these parameters are missing, the transaction will fail.

Validation on the frontend for Metamask users that are using the official SXPSwap tool. 2. Validation on the smart contract to only allow addresses with a certain prefix. 3. Validation on the backend program that sends the mainnet SXP to the new address. 4. Validation by the forging nodes that accept or deny the transaction created by the backend tool. Interacting with the contract directly and entering a wrong address by accident or on purpose will result in loss of funds. There is no way to recover the tokens from a contract and sending new SXP tokens on mainnet is impossible without a valid transaction on the contract side. Notes \u00b6 Other tokens can be sent to the SXPSwap contract. These tokens can not be recovered and will not be accepted by the backend program that broadcasts the swap to the forging delegates. Due to the validation by the backend program and the validation from the forging delegates, trying to send \"fake\" SXP tokens with a correct SXP mainnet address will have no impact on the swap procedure.

The first function \"approve\", which exists on the Swipe (SXP) token contract, this serves for the purpose of approving the SXPSwap contract to move the Swipe tokens over the new SXPSwap Contract. 2. The second function \"transferTokenToContract\", this serves for the purpose of sending the tokens that were previously approved to SXPSwap. Functions on the new contract.

The forging nodes will only process transactions from this wallet if the data in the memo matches with the response from the API's. Meaning that any other transactions sent from this wallet with a wrong address, wrong transaction ID or no memo at all, will be denied by the forging nodes. This also means that in case the private keys of this master address are leaked in the public or somehow obtained by a hacker, there is no way to move funds out of this wallet without matching data from SXPSwap. Even if it does contain matched data. Duplicate transactions with the same transaction ID are denied by the network. The plugins on the forging, relay and seed nodes are equiped with plugins that request data from several API's to verify transactions that are sent from the Swap Master Address.

Transaction ID with a minimum amount of confirmations. 2. Match the new wallet address with the wallet address provided in the contract. 3. Match the amount that is being sent to the new wallet with the amount that was transferred to the contract. 4. Validate if the SXPSwap contract has the right contract ID for SXP. 5.
