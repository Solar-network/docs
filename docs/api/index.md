# Introduction

This section serves as a reference for the available Solar Core APIs. These APIs expose configurable resources and data, such as the following:

1. [Public REST API](/api/public-rest-api/getting-started)
2. [Webhook API](/api/webhook-api/getting-started)

!!! tip "The API can also help monitor and troubleshoot your own node"

    Since each Core instance operates with its own internal blockchain and state, it's possible for it to become out of sync or forked, which may result in query failures. This makes the Solar Core APIs a valuable resource for managing your node and troubleshooting issues by comparing its responses with those of other nodes.
