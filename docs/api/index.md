# Introduction

This section serves as a reference for the available Solar Core APIs. These APIs expose configurable resources and data, such as the following:

1. [Public REST API](/api/public-rest-api/getting-started)
2. [Webhook API](/api/webhook-api/getting-started)

!!! info

    Each Core instance has its own internal blockchain and state, meaning it may have forked or be out of sync, causing queries to fail. Monitor your node by comparing it to different public nodes, such as the official Mainnet or Testnet Explorer to ensure you are in sync.

    - **Mainnet Explorer** - <a href="https://explorer.solar.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explorer.solar.org</a>
    - **Testnet Explorer** - <a href="https://texplorer.solar.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">texplorer.solar.org</a>
