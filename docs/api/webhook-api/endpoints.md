# Endpoints

## List All Webhooks

The webhooks resource returns all enabled and disabled webhooks. There is thus no need to store all active webhooks client side; as the node maintains a register for you.

### Endpoint

```bash
GET /api/webhooks
```

### Query Parameters

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :---: |
| page | int | The number of the page that will be returned. | No |
| limit | int | The number of resources per page. | No |

### Response

```javascript
{
  "meta": {
    "count": 29,
    "pageCount": 1,
    "totalCount": 29,
    "next": null,
    "previous": null,

  },
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "4b255244-a535-4aca-aa92-9ff9e02c98dd",
      "event": "block.forged",
      "target": "https://httpbin.org/post",

      "conditions": [
        {

## Retrieve a Webhook

It is possible to query for a specific webhook by ID, which has to be saved client-side or obtained from another API call.

### Endpoint

```bash
GET /api/webhooks/{id}
```

### Path Parameters

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :---: |
| id | string | The identifier of the webhook to be retrieved. | Yes |

### Response

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "id": "4b255244-a535-4aca-aa92-9ff9e02c98dd",
    "event": "block.forged",
    "target": "https://httpbin.org/post",
    "enabled": true,
    "conditions": [
      {
        "key": "generatorPublicKey",
        "condition": "eq",
        "value": "032fcfd19f0e095bf46bd3ada87e283720c405249b1be1a70bad1d5f20095a8515"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Create a Webhook

It is recommended to have a backend service running that will handle your webhook calls, as you'll have to provide a `target` value when creating the webhook. To give you an idea of how this works, we created a couple of [example setups](/api/webhook-api/usage#handling-webhooks) that you can use or get inspiration from. A webhook may be triggered by multiple conditions; as long as one of the conditions evaluates to `true`, the webhook will fire.

The returned `token` should be saved and used to validate the webhook origin. It is a secret value which should not be shared. For extra security, whitelist the IP of the node with your target service, ensuring other parties are not able to post webhook payloads.

The `conditions` lists consists of an `array` of objects, with the following properties:

* `key`: the key used on the object that is passed along with the specified event
* `condition`: a [condition](/api/webhook-api/endpoints#conditions) used to check the value against
* `value`: (Optional) a value used to check the `key` against. This is not needed for the `falsy` and `truthy` conditions. In case of `between` and `not-between`, you'll have to provide an object like this: `"value": { "min": "someValue", "max": "someValue" }`

### Endpoint

```bash
POST /api/webhooks
```

## Update a Webhook

Existing webhooks may be updated. _Note that this is the equivalent of deleting and creating a webhook; but retaining the same token_. If you are often updating and creating webhooks; consider deleting and creating new webhooks instead of updating to rotate your validation token often.
