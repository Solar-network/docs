# Exchanges API Guide

!!! tip "Explore Solar Core's interactive REST API documentation here: [Solar Core API Endpoints](/api/public-rest-api/endpoints)"

Connecting to the Public API is done via the [Crypto and Client SDKs](/sdk/documentation/). Many queries can be performed using the Client SDK alone, while the Crypto SDK performs any actions requiring cryptographic functionality (i.e., signing transactions).

At a surface level, the two SDKs are separated by their functions and intended use cases:

* The Crypto SDK provides the cryptographic functions necessary to verify and validate Solar transactions.
* The Client SDK provides wrapper functions to unify and streamline API calls between your application and the Solar blockchain.

Put another way, the Crypto SDK structures your data in a format that all Solar nodes can understand, while the Client SDK handles the actual communication between your application and a Solar node. Where the Crypto SDK is internal, the Client SDK is external, as the below diagram illustrates:

![clientCrypto](/exchanges/assets/client-crypto.png)

!!! note

    The Public API is only available after a node has fully synced. This ensures your data on the blockchain is up to date.

## Setup

These quick actions will all assume you've loaded a Client instance with the IP address of your node and the API version you're requesting.

```typescript
import { Connection } from "@solar-network/client";
const client = new Connection("https://tapi.solar.org/api");
```

!!! tip

    Use `https://api.solar.org/api` for the Solar Network mainnet.

    _You can also use the IP address and port of any Core node that has the Public API enabled (e.g., `http://65.108.90.71:6003`)_.

## Check wallet balance

Checking a wallet balance involves using the `wallets` resource to `GET` the wallet corresponding to a given Solar address.

```typescript
const wallet = await client.api("wallets").get("D61mfSggzbvQgTUe6JhYKH2doHaqJ3Dyib");

console.log(wallet.body.data.balance);
```

## Find block information

If you know the ID of the block you are looking for, you can use the `GET` method on the `blocks` resource to return information on that block.

```typescript
const block = await client.api("blocks").get("405899a308c07aee8a7b4fb807d03ca4454ee5ba295365b302e30683c5c01be5");

console.log(block);
```

Alternatively, if you are not sure of the block ID, or if you want to find all blocks in a range, you can make use of the `blocks all` method. This endpoint accepts a JSON object representing the search parameters to use when narrowing down a list of blocks.

The following block properties can be used to create your range:

* timestamp
* height
* numberOfTransactions
* totalAmount
* totalFee
* reward
* payloadLength

To use any of these properties as a range, include the relevant key in your request as an object containing `from` and `to` specifiers.

For example, this code can be used to search all blocks between blockchain heights 720 and 735 with total fees between 0 and 2000 satoshi:

```typescript
const blocks = await client.api("blocks").all({
    height: {
      from: 500000,
      to: 800000
    },
    totalFee: {
      from: 0,
      to: 2000
    }
  });

  console.log(blocks); // all blocks matching the search criteria
```

## Create and broadcast transactions

To create transactions, make use of the **transactionBuilder** module of `@solar-network/crypto`. First, install the package from pnpm or equivalent:

```bash
pnpm install @solar-network/crypto
```

The `crypto` package functionality we'll use here is the transactionBuilder, which provides a series of "chainable" methods that can be called, one after another, to produce a transaction object. These methods create and define your transaction: its type, its amount in satoshi, its signature, and more.

Regardless of which SDK you use, every transactionBuilder contains a similar function to `getStruct`, which will return a completed transaction object.

After making one or more of these transaction objects, you can combine them into an array to use as the `transactions` key in your request.

With all the steps together, here is an example of how to send a transaction for approval:

```typescript
import { Transactions, Managers, Utils } from "@solar-network/crypto";
import { Connection } from "@solar-network/client";

// Configure our API client
const client = new Connection("https://tapi.solar.org/api");

// Set the network configuration
Managers.configManager.setFromPreset("testnet");
Managers.configManager.setHeight(1000000);

(async () => {
    // Step 1: Retrieve the incremental nonce of the sender wallet
    const senderWallet = await client.api("wallets").get("YOUR_SENDER_WALLET_ADDRESS");
    const senderNonce = Utils.BigNumber.make(senderWallet.body.data.nonce).plus(1);

    // Step 2: Create the transaction
    const transaction = Transactions.BuilderFactory.transfer()
        .nonce(senderNonce.toFixed())
        .fee("30000000")
        .memo("This is an example memo") // memo is optional
        .addTransfer("Address of Recipient Wallet 1","100000000") // 1 tSXP
        .addTransfer("Address of Recipient Wallet 2","200000000") // 2 tSXP
        .addTransfer("Address of Recipient Wallet 3","300000000") // 3 tSXP
        .sign("this is a top secret passphrase");

    // Step 4: Broadcast the transaction
    const broadcastResponse = await client.api("transactions").create({ transactions: [transaction.build().toJson()] });

    // Step 5: Log the response
    console.log(JSON.stringify(broadcastResponse.body.data, null, 4))
})();
```

When sending your request using the `client`, ensure that the value of `transactions` is an array, even if you have only one transaction object.

If your request is successful, you will receive a response with the following `data` key:

```javascript
{
  data: {
      accept: [ '96e3952b66a370d8145055b55cedc6f1435b3a71cb17334aa954f8844ad1202f' ],
      broadcast: [ '96e3952b66a370d8145055b55cedc6f1435b3a71cb17334aa954f8844ad1202f' ],
      excess: [],
      invalid: []
    },
  errors: null
}
```

Let us look at the returned `data` object in more depth. It is composed of four arrays, each holding zero or more transaction IDs:

1. `accept` - a list of all accepted transactions
2. `broadcast` - a list of all transactions broadcast to the network
3. `excess` - if the node's pool is full, this lists all excess transactions
4. `invalid` - a list of all transactions deemed invalid by the node

Our sample code above submitted one transaction, which the node accepted and broadcast and thus the `accept` and `broadcast` arrays contain precisely one item each: the ID of the transaction we submitted.

If we had submitted any invalid transactions, the `invalid` list would have contained their IDs, and the `errors` key would have been populated with one error per invalid transaction.

The diagram below offers a top-level overview of the transaction submission process:

## Check transaction confirmations

Once a transaction has been created and added to the blockchain, you can access the number of confirmations it has by using the `transactions` resource to `get` the value matching the transaction ID.

```typescript
const transaction = await client.api("transactions").get("5ad7a65e68ac24821f90504202cb464fb845faa53736f16b94f6756a2dc2bea3");

console.log(transaction);
```

If the transaction has been added to the blockchain, you'll receive the following data structure in your console:

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "id": "5ad7a65e68ac24821f90504202cb464fb845faa53736f16b94f6756a2dc2bea3",

        },

          "amount": "5325",
          "recipientId": "DL15Z3K8k2TCoqKPB8TZjTv89ApvDPoUZd"
        },
        {
          "amount": "2697",
          "recipientId": "DGSzda5FfkQDPUmFrM4Xodty2LWnamTpCk"
        },
        {
          "amount": "2670",
          "recipientId": "DEAH8FiXrxfGaoHE7PEHtgz8rxzpqRQMGT"

          "recipientId": "DQYiSMyoftk7KibjtaD2ppUe1KnxF4MvCT"
        }
      ]
    },
    "confirmations": 189,
    "timestamp": {
      "epoch": 12258008,
      "unix": 1670598008,
      "human": "2022-12-09T15:00:08.000Z"
    },
    "nonce": "6168"
  }
}
```

You can see that the `confirmations` key holds the number of confirmations this transaction has received from the network, in the above case 0. As the average block takes 8 seconds to forge, finality is typically established within a minute following a transaction's addition to the blockchain.

## Listening for transactions

it is possible to retrieve all transactions of a wallet given its address and, optionally, add filters.

```typescript
// Getting all transaction of a wallet sent after height 1000000
const transactions = await client.api("wallets").transactions("D61mfSggzbvQgTUe6JhYKH2doHaqJ3Dyib", {blockHeight: {from: 1000000}});

console.log(transactions.body.data);
```

!!! info

    Transfer transactions can be either **LegacyTransfer** (typegroup 1, type 0) or **Transfer** (typegroup 1, type 6). When listening for incoming transactions, it is essential to monitor for both of these types of transfer.

## Check node status

Checking node status can be done by using the `node` resource's `status` method:

```typescript
const status = await client.api("node").status();
console.log(status);
```

By running this code, you'd see the output in your console resembling the following object:

```javascript
{
  "data": {
    "synced": true,       // whether this node is fully synchronised with the network
    "now": 1509905,       // the current network height of this node's blockchain
    "blocksCount": 0,     // if not synced, the number of blocks yet to be synced
    "timestamp": 12259598 // the node's current network (epoch) time
  }
}
```

If `synced` is true, your node is operating as expected and fully synced with the Solar network. Otherwise, use the `blocksCount` key to get an estimation of how long your node will take to sync.
