## **Resign your Block Producer**

"Block Producer Resignation" is a transaction type being offered in Solar Core that gives block producers the ability to either temporarily or permanently resign and exclude themselves from the block producer rankings. Only a temporary resignation can be revoked by submitting a Resignation Recovation transaction.

1. **Open the Solar Desktop Wallet and select the vertical ellipsis icon next to the right of the send button.**
2. **Select the dropdown menu under Registration and select "Resign Block Producer"**
3. **Enter your wallet’s mnemonic (or password if you are using encrypted option) and confirm the transaction.**
4. **Refresh your wallet and you will see that after the next round of forging, your block producer will be marked resigned and no longer counted in the active block producer rankings (top 53).**
