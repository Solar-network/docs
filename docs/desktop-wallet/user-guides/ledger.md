# Solar Ledger App Guide

## Introduction

This guide will help you get started in using your Ledger hardware wallet with the Solar Desktop Wallet software. Your Ledger device uses an offline, or cold storage, method of generating private keys, making it among the most secure ways to store cryptoassets, including Solar (SXP). 

With this enhanced security, your private keys remain offline and all transactions require physical confirmation on your device, protecting your funds from online threats and malware. It enables you to sign transactions securely, so you can send SXP or vote for your favourite block producers without the need to enter your mnemonic.

## Before you start

This guide assumes you have the following set up, updated to the latest versions, and ready to use:

* A Ledger hardware wallet (Nano S Plus, Nano X, Flex or Stax device) - [https://shop.ledger.com](https://shop.ledger.com/#category-cryptocurrency-wallets)
* Ledger Live - [https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download)
* Solar Desktop Wallet - [https://solar.org/desktop-wallet](https://solar.org/desktop-wallet)

!!! info

    Ensure your Ledger device firmware is updated to the latest version through Ledger Live before proceeding with installation of the Solar app.

## Installing the Solar Ledger App

You can find and install the Solar Ledger app using Ledger Live.

**1. Open Ledger Live Desktop**

## Viewing Solar (SXP) Ledger Wallets

After having installed the Solar app, your Ledger device is ready to be used with the Solar Desktop Wallet.

**1. Close Ledger Live Desktop**

Having multiple Ledger-supported applications opened at the same time on your computer can interfere with the connection to your Ledger device, so you'll want to make sure Ledger Live, or any other software that connects to Ledger devices, is closed.

**2. Connect your Ledger device**

If not already connected and unlocked, connect your Ledger device to your computer and unlock it using your PIN.

**3. Open the Solar Ledger app**

Next, open the Solar Ledger app on your Ledger device.

**4. Open the Solar Desktop Wallet**

Once initialised, the Solar Desktop Wallet will load and display your Ledger wallets and their SXP balances.

## Receiving and Sending Solar (SXP)

A Solar Ledger wallet works just like a traditional mnemonic-protected Solar wallet.

### Receiving Solar (SXP)

_Receive_ SXP from anyone by sharing your unique Solar (SXP) Ledger wallet address(es) with them.

You can find a wallet's unique address in its banner as seen below.

**Take your time** clicking through to verify that the transaction details are correct, pay close attention to the recipient’s Solar address and the amount of SXP you're being shown. Make sure that it matches what you entered using the Solar Desktop Wallet.

If **everything** looks correct and you'd like to proceed with sending the transaction, click '**Approve**' using your Ledger device.

If the details don't match, you'd like to make a change before sending, or you've simply changed your mind and no longer wish to proceed with the transaction, click '**Reject**' using your Ledger device.

![](/desktop-wallet/assets/ledger/ledger-x-reject.png)

**4. Confirm and Send**

After reviewing and approving the transaction details using your Ledger device, you'll have a third and final opportunity to review the transaction details before broadcasting it to the network.

## Troubleshooting

### My Solar Desktop Wallet does not show any Ledger wallets

1. Make sure your Ledger device is connected to your computer, that it is unlocked, and that the Solar Ledger app is opened. The screen of your Ledger device should say ‘**Solar is ready**.’
2. Make sure Ledger Live, or any other software that connects to Ledger devices, is not opened as this can interfere with a Ledger device's connection.
3. Make sure you have installed the latest version of the Solar Desktop Wallet, available here: [https://solar.org/desktop-wallet](https://solar.org/desktop-wallet).
4. Restart the Solar Desktop Wallet or 'Force Reload' it using `CTRL + SHIFT + R` (Windows) or `CMD + SHIFT + R` (Linux, macOS)
