# Solar Ledger App Guide

## Introduction

This guide will help you get started in using your Ledger hardware wallet with the Solar Desktop Wallet software. Your Ledger device uses an offline, or cold storage, method of generating private keys, making it among the most secure ways to store cryptoassets, including Solar (SXP).

With this enhanced security, your private keys remain offline and all transactions require physical confirmation on your device, protecting your funds from online threats and malware. It enables you to sign transactions securely, so you can send SXP or vote for your favourite block producers without the need to enter your mnemonic.

## Before you start

## Troubleshooting

### My Solar Desktop Wallet does not show any Ledger wallets

1. Make sure your Ledger device is connected to your computer, that it is unlocked, and that the Solar Ledger app is opened. The screen of your Ledger device should say ‘**Solar is ready**.’
2. Make sure Ledger Live, or any other software that connects to Ledger devices, is not opened as this can interfere with a Ledger device's connection.
3. Make sure you have installed the latest version of the Solar Desktop Wallet, available here: [https://solar.org/desktop-wallet](https://solar.org/desktop-wallet).
4. Restart the Solar Desktop Wallet or 'Force Reload' it using `CTRL + SHIFT + R` (Windows) or `CMD + SHIFT + R` (Linux, macOS)
