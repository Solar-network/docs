# Solar Ledger App Guide

## Introduction

This guide will help you get started in using your Ledger hardware wallet with the Solar Desktop Wallet software. Your Ledger device uses an offline, or cold storage, method of generating private keys, making it among the most secure ways to store cryptoassets, including Solar (SXP). It enables you to sign transactions securely, so you can send SXP or vote for your favourite delegates without the need to enter your mnemonic recovery passphrase.

## Before you start

This guide assumes you have the following set up, updated to the latest versions, and ready to use:

* Ledger Live - [https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download)
* Solar Desktop Wallet - [https://solar.org/desktop-wallet](https://solar.org/desktop-wallet)

You can find and install the Solar Ledger app using Ledger Live.

## Viewing Solar (SXP) Ledger Wallets

After having installed the Solar app, your Ledger device is ready to be used with the Solar Desktop Wallet.

**1. Close Ledger Live Desktop**

Having multiple Ledger-supported applications opened at the same time on your computer can interfere with the connection to your Ledger device, so you'll want to make sure Ledger Live, or any other software that connects to Ledger devices, is closed.

**2. Connect your Ledger device**

If not already connected and unlocked, connect your Ledger device to your computer and unlock it using your PIN.

**3. Open the Solar Ledger app**

Next, open the Solar Ledger app on your Ledger device.

> _Your device should now display "_Solar is ready_" as shown above._

**4. Open the Solar Desktop Wallet**

Once initialised, the Solar Desktop Wallet will load and display your Ledger wallets and their SXP balances.

## Receiving and Sending Solar (SXP)

A Solar Ledger wallet works just like a traditional passphrase-protected Solar wallet.

### Receiving Solar (SXP)

_Receive_ SXP from anyone by sharing your unique Solar (SXP) Ledger wallet address(es) with them.

You can find a wallet's unique address in its banner as seen below.

### Sending Solar (SXP)

_Send_ SXP using your Ledger device and the Solar Desktop Wallet.

**1. Open a Solar (SXP) Ledger wallet**

Using the Solar Desktop Wallet, open the Solar (SXP) Ledger address from which you'd like to send funds, then click '**Send**.'

![](/desktop-wallet/assets/ledger/transfer-1.gif)

> _Make sure your Ledger device is connected and unlocked and that the Solar app is opened._

**2. Enter the Transfer Details**

Enter the recipient's wallet address (or pick one from your address book) and the amount of SXP you'd like to send.

After entering and reviewing the information, click '**Next**' to proceed.

![](/desktop-wallet/assets/transfer-2.gif)

**3. Confirm using your Ledger Device**

You will now be required to review the transaction details using your Ledger device.

**Take your time** clicking through to verify that the transaction details are correct, pay close attention to the recipient’s Solar address and the amount of SXP you're being shown. Make sure that it matches what you entered using the Solar Desktop Wallet.

If **everything** looks correct and you'd like to proceed with sending the transaction, click '**Approve**' using your Ledger device.

![](/desktop-wallet/assets/ledger/ledger-x-approve.png)

If the details don't match, you'd like to make a change before sending, or you've simply changed your mind and no longer wish to proceed with the transaction, click '**Reject**' using your Ledger device.

![](/desktop-wallet/assets/ledger/ledger-x-reject.png)

**4. Confirm and Send**

After reviewing and approving the transaction details using your Ledger device, you'll have a third and final opportunity to review the transaction details before broadcasting it to the network.

If everything looks good and you'd like to proceed with the transaction, click the ‘**Send**’ button as shown below.

## Troubleshooting

### My Solar Desktop Wallet does not show any Ledger wallets

1. Make sure your Ledger device is connected to your computer, that it is unlocked, and that the Solar Ledger app is opened. The screen of your Ledger device should say ‘**Solar is ready**.’
2. Make sure Ledger Live, or any other software that connects to Ledger devices, is not opened as this can interfere with a Ledger device's connection.
3. Make sure you have installed the latest version of the Solar Desktop Wallet, available here: [https://solar.org/desktop-wallet](https://solar.org/desktop-wallet).
4. Restart the Solar Desktop Wallet or 'Force Reload' it using `CTRL + SHIFT + R` (Windows) or `CMD + SHIFT + R` (Linux, macOS)
