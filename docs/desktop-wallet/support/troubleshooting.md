## Connectivity Issues

Some of the more common issues are related to **peer** and **network** <u>**connectivity**</u>.

### Recognizing Connectivity Issues

Users having **connectivity** issues will typically experience the following:

- **Incomplete Transaction History**
- **Incorrect Balances**
- **Transaction Send Errors**

Common **error messages** associated with **connectivity** issues include—but are not limited to—the following:

- **"Cannot Connect"**
- **"Failed to connect to peer"**
- **"…fee is not valid"**
- **"Initialization is taking longer than expected…"**
- **"…invalid seed nodes…"**
- **"No internet connection"**
- **"…transaction could not be created / sent / registered…"**
- **"Version 2 Not Supported"**

### Resolving Connectivity issues

**Connectivity** issues are typically resolved by <u>**refreshing**</u> your **peer connection**.

![Select the ‘cloud’ icon on the left sidebar. Then click the "Refresh" button of the Peer modal as shown above.](/desktop-wallet/assets/troubleshooting-refresh-peer.jpg)

---

If the issue persists after **refreshing** the peer connection, you can also perform a "**Force Reload**".

This restarts all services related to the SXP Desktop Wallet, no data will be lost.

![Select "Force Reload" from the "View" drop-down menu.](/desktop-wallet/assets/troubleshooting-force-reload.jpeg)

!!! info

    If the **connection issues** are **not** resolved using the advice above, check that your connections are not being blocked by **Firewall** or **Antivirus Software**.

## Wallet Issues

<u>**Wallet**</u> issues are encountered while attempting to <u>**import**</u>/<u>**restore**</u> a wallet using a **mnemonic recovery passphrase**.

### Recognizing Wallet Issues

Users having **Wallet** issues will typically experience the following:

- **Incorrect Address**
- **Missing Balance**
- **Missing Transaction History**

### Resolving Wallet Issues

**Wallet** issues are commonly resolved by double-checking that your <u>**recovery passphrase**</u> is correct.

A word may have been misspelled or extra characters might have been entered by mistake.

!!! info

    A mnemonic recovery passphrase should be all <u>**lower-case**</u> letters with a <u>**single space**</u> between <u>**each**</u> word.

---

### My Recovery Phrase Was Entered as Recorded!

If the mnemonic passphrase was entered **exactly** as recorded, compare each word to the official list found here:<br>[BIP-39 Wordlist: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoin/bips/master/bip-0039/english.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoin/bips/master/bip-0039/english.txt)

!!! info

    The purpose of checking this wordlist is to ensure that similar words were not recorded inadvertently.<br>*e.g. "aim" vs "air"; "fine" vs "find"; "seek" vs "seed"*

---

### My Recovery Phrase is Gone!
In most cases, the above advice will help a user successfully recover their wallet.

Unfortunately, no mechanism exists to recover a lost recovery mnemonic. This security design is a fundamental element of Blockchain technology.

It is <u>**always**</u> advised to write your recovery phrase down on paper, double and triple check that it is written down correctly, keep it safe and **share it with no one**.

!!! danger

    Your 12-word passphrase is <u>**your**</u> responsibility. If it is lost or stolen, you <u>**will**</u> lose access to your funds. Lost mnemonic recovery passphrases are <u>**NOT**</u> recoverable.

## Signing Issues

<u>**Signing**</u> issues are encountered when attempting to <u>**sign a transaction**</u>.

### Recognizing Signing Issues

Users having **Signing** issues will typically receive the following **error messages**:

- **"Invalid Passphrase"**
- **"Failed to Decrypt Passphrase"**
- **"Failed to sign the transaction"**
- **"Transaction could not be created"**

### Resolving Signing Issues

**Signing** issues are resolved by checking that you are either:

- a) using the correct <u>**encryption password**</u>
- b) using the correct <u>**recovery passphrase**</u>

!!! info

  Users should also check that they are not using the <u>**Mnemonic Passphrase**</u> *as* the <u>**Encryption Password**</u>, or <u>**Encryption Password**</u> *as* the <u>**Mnemonic Passphrase**</u>.

---

### My Encryption Password is Wrong!

If only the **encryption password** is wrong.. **FUNDS SAFU!**

The **encryption password** is only used to help "*hide*" your keys; try re-importing your wallet using its **mnemonic passphrase**.

!!! warning

    An encryption password **must** contain at least:<br>- 8 characters in total<br>- 1 upper-case character<br>- 1 lower-case character<br>- 1 number<br>- 1 special character

---

### My Recovery Phrase <u>Seems</u> Correct!

If your **mnemonic passphrase** appears to be correct, check that it was **entered** correctly.

A word may have been misspelled or extra characters might have been entered by mistake.

!!! info

    If the mnemonic passphrase was entered exactly as recorded, refer to the section on checking a passphrase <u>[here](#resolving-wallet-issues)</u>.

!!! warning

    Users should also check that they are properly **connected** to a **valid network peer**.

!!! info

    Advice on troubleshooting a **network connection** can be found <u>[here](#resolving-connectivity-issues)</u>.

### My Ledger issue is still not resolved!

Most **Ledger** **connectivity** and **transaction** issues will be resolved by following the advice above.

In rare cases, a user's profile may have become corrupted.

A user is then advised to **restore** the SXP Desktop Wallet to its **default settings**, then **re-import** wallets and watch-addresses.

!!! info

    Note that **Ledger** wallets are imported <u>**only**</u> by **connecting** to the SXP Desktop Wallet. <u>**NEVER**</u> enter your 24-word Ledger recovery phrase into <u>**any**</u> software, apps or websites.

## Debugging Tips

Sometimes, a **user** or **developer** may require **additional** information when **troubleshooting** or **debugging** issues within the **SXP Desktop Wallet**.
