# Solar Core v3 Transactions

Transactions are the heart of any blockchain, traditionally representing a transfer of value from one network participant to another. In SXP, transactions can be of one of many types which can impact the content and data structure of each transaction's payload.

This section will help you learn about Solar transactions, their structures and the processes of serialisating and deserialising transactions.

    <p>Use the Solar SDKs to build applications utilising the Solar blockchain.</p>

        <p class="admonition-title">The SXP SDKs are split into two packages for each language:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Client SDKs</b> - help developers fetch information from the SXP blockchain about its current state: which delegates are currently forging, what transactions are associated with a given wallet, and so on.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cryptography SDKs</b> - assist developers in working with transactions: signing, serialising, deserialising, etc.
