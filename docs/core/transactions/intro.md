    <p>Use the Solar SDKs to build applications utilising the Solar blockchain.</p>
    <div class="admonition abstract">
        <p class="admonition-title">The Solar SDKs are split into two packages for each language:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Client SDKs</b> - help developers fetch information from the Solar blockchain about its current state: which delegates are currently forging, what transactions are associated with a given wallet, and so on.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cryptography SDKs</b> - assist developers in working with transactions: signing, serialising, deserialising, etc.
            </li>
