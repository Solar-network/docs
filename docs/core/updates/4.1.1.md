## Upgrade instructions

- If you are a delegate, please be aware that this update will perform a destructive modification to your `delegates.json` file, overwriting your delegate passphrase(s) with their hexadecimal private key equivalents. Please make sure you have your passphrases backed up somewhere safe prior to updating to Core 4.1.1 because you will not be able to retrieve your passphrase(s) from delegates.json anymore.

- Also, you should update your primary node BEFORE updating any backups.
