Make sure to write your mnemonic recovery phrase down on paper and keep it somewhere safe.

    If your mnemonic is ever lost, there is no way to recover it or restore your account.

### 3. Plan for gas fees

Make sure the wallet holding your SXP tokens (BEP20 or ERC20) has enough gas to cover fees for both â€“ the contract approval and the swap itself.

### 4. Go to the swap site

In the Trust Wallet app, click 'Browser', then visit the swap website: <a href="https://swap.solar.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swap.solar.org</a>

Once the welcome screen has loaded, scroll down and click 'Next'.
