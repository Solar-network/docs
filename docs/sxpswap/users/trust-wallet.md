    Other versions of Trust Wallet (Android, Chrome extension, etc.) may look somewhat different, but the general steps are the same.

### 1. Create a Solar mainnet address

Create a mainnet address using the <a href="https://solar.org/wallets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar Desktop Wallet</a>, or you can learn more about [creating wallets](/desktop-wallet/user-guides/create-import-wallets/).

### 2. Store your recovery mnemonic securely

Make sure to write your mnemonic recovery phrase down on paper and keep it somewhere safe.

!!! danger "Do not lose this mnemonic recovery phrase and do not share it with anyone!"

### 3. Plan for gas fees

Make sure the wallet holding your SXP tokens (BEP20 or ERC20) has enough gas to cover fees for both – the contract approval and the swap itself.

### 4. Go to the swap site

In the Trust Wallet app, click 'Browser', then visit the swap website: <a href="https://swap.solar.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swap.solar.org</a>

Once the welcome screen has loaded, scroll down and click 'Next'.
